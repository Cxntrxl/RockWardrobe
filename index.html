            <h2>Rock Wardrobe is temporarily down</h2>
            <p>Notice from Cxntrxl:</p>
            <p>It has come to my attention that RockWardrobe, being a github.io site, was a public repo this entire time (oops).</p>
            <p>Because of this, player models have been freely accessible through my github account for some time now. Free distribution of licensed assets was not my intention, and as such I am temporarily taking RockWardrobe offline until I can migrate to a more secure website host. I apologise for the inconvenience.</p>

            <h2>Rock Wardrobe has had a link change!</h2>
            <p>Notice from Cxntrxl:</p>
            <p>Rock Wardrobe has been moved from https://cxntrxl.github.io/RockWardrobe/ to https://rockwardrobe.pages.dev/.</p>
            <p>The old page will automatically redirect users after 5 seconds. Please reset any bookmarks or desktop shortcuts to the new page in order to remove this redirect time. Thank you for your patience!</p>
